Hey :)
Creality is organizing a Creator Contest and currently the voting is going on. I would be very grateful if you could take a few minutes and vote for my entry. You have to use the Creality Cloud App for this (maybe you have to search for the Creality DIY Group by yourself. You can vote by click on the heart).

All parts without Voron files for the Belt Driven Ender 3 V3(https://github.com/kevinakasam/BeltDrivenEnder3/tree/main/V3/Voronparts)

Huge thanks to my mate Deutherius, who helped me over months, tested everything and brought this mod to perfection. Many thanks for the help, the photos and the new heated bed!

Attention!
I'm not an expert and 3D printing is my hobby. So please be careful when you rebuild this printer and don't just go ahead. For my printer the parts fit perfectly.
Everybody bears the risks of a modification himself.
All parts can be modified as you like.

First things first:
My Ender 3 always had problems in the Z-axis, which were caused by a bent spindle. Therefore I decided to convert the Ender to belts in Z as well.
This conversion also solves the problem of a hanging x-axis on the right side. Because of the two belts, the two sides not only run synchronously, but can also be adjusted very precisely.
So if you have all these problems with the x-axis, this is a good solution.

Good luck and happy printing!

14.02.2021: Changes for the MGN Version!! LeftV1 added. Please print 1_Left and 1_LeftV1. I would appreciate feedback for Left or LeftV1. I have created the files with the official CAD, but the M4 screws differ in the position by 2mm. Please print both versions and tell me which fits, thanks:)
26.02.2021: Added Bowdenversion. Untested!!
