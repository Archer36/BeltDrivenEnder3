Huge thanks to my mate Deutherius, who helped me over months, tested everything and brought this mod to perfection. Many thanks for the help, the photos and the new heated bed!

Attention!
I'm not an expert and 3D printing is my hobby. So please be careful when you rebuild this printer and don't just go ahead. For my printer the parts fit perfectly.
Everybody bears the risks of a modification himself.
All parts can be modified as you like.

First things first:
My Ender 3 always had problems in the Z-axis, which were caused by a bent spindle. Therefore I decided to convert the Ender to belts in Z as well.
This conversion also solves the problem of a hanging x-axis on the right side. Because of the two belts, the two sides not only run synchronously, but can also be adjusted very precisely.
So if you have all these problems with the x-axis, this is a good solution.

Good luck and happy printing!
