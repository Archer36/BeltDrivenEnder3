All Files from normal V3 needed, except the spacers.

All Files are tested.

I have uploaded a distance bracket to make it easier to attach the rails.


I would appreciate feedback for Left or LeftV1. I have created the files with the official CAD, but the M4 screws differ in the position by 2mm. Please print both versions and tell me which fits, thanks:)
