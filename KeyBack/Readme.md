#### Files are currently untested! Please give me feedback when you installed the KeyBack (Discord: kevinakasam#2097)


KeyBack system similar to the Switchwire design.
The files were remixed from the Switchwire CAD file.
For licensing reasons, all KeyBack files are uploaded to GitHub only!
Idea from Voron team, thanks!

Info: Because of the transmission it is not necessary to install a KeyBack system.
The 1:5 ratio increases the holding force of the motor so that it can hold the X axis up even when it is powered off.
A correctly adjusted belt tension is important for this.
If you are using the V-Wheels it is also important that they are installed correctly (See Troubleshooting).
From time to time I hear that users struggle to keep the axis up by using the belt tension only.
Therefore, I have designed the KeyBack system. See BOM for all the parts you need.

What is a KeyBack system and what is it for?
A KeyBack is actually used to secure keys to a wire rope.
Depending on the Keyback, they can support a lot of weight without the cord extending on its own.
The KeyBack used here is strong enough to support the x axis. It takes the load off the motor and shares the weight of the axis with it.
__It is still important to tension the belts properly!
If the belts are not tightened enough, there will be unclean prints later!__
So make sure that the KeyBack doesn't mislead you into not tightening the belts enough.
See my FAQ video on how to properly tension the belts (video coming soon).

You will have to print a new 1_LeftTop_A and a 3_spacer to use the KeyBack.
